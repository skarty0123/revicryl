# Revicryl
Revicryl is a Python Program in which artists can upload their choice of picture which they wish to draw and find out which acrylic paint shall be used to color the picture. The purpose of this project is to identify the exact shade of colours and its market availability so that the artist can dedicate more time to creating their masterpiece than to mixing colours to find the right shade. This reduces the wastage in terms of paint and the time of the artist and also gives the artist the idea of how their artistic work would be rendered on social media and also at the same time try out the various combinations that aree compatible with each other. In addition to that, minor changes in the colour compatibility and the adjustment in the tones can also be rendered using this project. This makes the work suitable for both real-time artistic rendering and to be used as an digital piece of art that can then be used as a NFT or other as an stock image. This the aim of this project.
